Key items for awareness prior to running the run_analysis.R program:

The run_analysis.R file requires the dplyr package. This package will be automatically installed if it is currently not installed in the user machine. 

Data files will be downloaded in a folder named "CourseraData". The program will create this folder automatically. 

The output of this program is a Tidy Dataset, which is written in the output file named tbl_tidyData.txt. 

The program also creates a number of interim tables so that the all 5 of the requirements can be independently validated. All table names start with the suffic "tbl_". For the purposes of satisfying Requirement #5, tbl_tidyData is the tidy dataset for user's review.

For user convenience, the Program also outputs the tidy dataset in a table view.
