Data Code Book
=================

The tidy data file tbl_tidyData.txt is grouped by Activity Type and then by Subject. There are a set of 6 activities, and 30 subjects. The tidy table shows averages of each variable for each Activity and Subject combination.  

In order to make the data more descriptive, the following updates were made to the variable naming convention in the original dataset

std() changed to StandardDeviation
mean() changed to Mean
^t changed to Time
^f changed to Frequency
Acc changed to Accelerometer
Gyro changed to Gyroscope
Mag changed to Magnitude
BodyBody changed to Body

As a result, the following are the new variables. Again, these show the average value of measurement for these variables.
